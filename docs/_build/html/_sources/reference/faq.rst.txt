Does a Mendelian error mean “false positive”?
---------------------------------------------

| Not necessarily. Mendelian errors include: - technical artifacts - true *de novo* CNVs
| *De novo* CNVs are rare, so Mendelian errors are enriched for artifacts, but validation is required.

What overlap threshold should I use?
------------------------------------

| A common default is reciprocal overlap ≥50%.
| You may increase it for strict matching or decrease it when breakpoints are noisy.

Can I use MCNV2 on WES or arrays?
---------------------------------

Yes. MCNV2 is technology-agnostic as long as CNVs are provided in the standard tabular format and trios are available.
